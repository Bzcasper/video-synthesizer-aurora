STEP-BY-STEP TASKS
Video Generation Form Improvement
Video Preview & Player Enhancement
Video Processing Status Visualization
Landing Page Optimization
Mobile Responsiveness
Performance Optimization
Error Handling & User Feedback
Documentation & Metadata Setup
Each step includes a prompt (suitable for Lovable.dev or general usage), followed by a detailed explanation of how to implement the changes.

1. Video Generation Form Improvement
   Prompt:

Refine the Video Generation Form

Split the form into logical sections (e.g., “Video Settings” and “Style Options”).
Add real-time validation for each field using Zod or React Hook Form.
Display inline error messages near invalid fields.
Add a “Generate Video” button that shows a loading state on submission and disables itself to avoid duplicates.
Show helpful placeholders or tooltips explaining each field.
Implementation Details:

File(s) to Update: src/pages/VideoForm.tsx (or wherever the form is implemented).
Sections: Separate crucial parts (title, description/prompt, duration, style) so users can see relevant fields together.
Validation: For example, if using React Hook Form + Zod Resolver, define a Zod schema (z.object({...})) specifying required fields and data types.
UI: Integrate shadcn-ui form components to maintain consistency. Show error messages below each field in red.
Loading State: Disable the “Generate Video” button after click, swap its text to “Generating…” or a spinner.
Tooltips/Placeholder: Provide guidance for any complex or advanced fields. 2. Video Preview & Player Enhancement
Prompt:

Enhance the Video Preview and Player

Implement a custom video player or enhance the default HTML5 <video> with a consistent aurora theme.
Add playback controls, loading state, and error fallback if the video fails to load.
Display metadata (title, creation date, duration) near the player.
Allow full-screen toggling or a popout option.
Implementation Details:

File(s) to Update: Possibly src/pages/VideoPreview.tsx or src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx.
Custom Player: If using a library (e.g., react-player or a shadcn-based solution), style it with Tailwind utility classes.
Loading State: Show a skeleton or spinner while the video buffer is loading.
Error Handling: If the video source is invalid, display a fallback message like “Video not found” or “Couldn’t load video.”
Controls: Provide play/pause, volume, progress bar, fullscreen button. On mobile, ensure the controls remain accessible. 3. Video Processing Status Visualization
Prompt:

Implement Clear Video Processing Status

After a user starts generating a video, show a status indicator or progress bar.
If possible, fetch real-time updates (polling or WebSockets) on the generation steps.
Display a “Generating…” overlay or modal that provides an estimated wait time or progress percentage.
Transition to the final preview automatically when generation completes.
Implementation Details:

UI: A modal or overlay with a spinner/progress bar can replace the form once submission begins.
Realtime: If the backend supports it, use WebSockets or periodic polling to update progress.
Steps: Show textual steps if percentage-based progress is not available (e.g., “Preparing frames”, “Assembling video”, “Finalizing”).
Completion: Once done, automatically redirect the user to VideoPreview or the new video’s page with a success toast. 4. Landing Page Optimization
Prompt:

Optimize the Landing Page

Create a hero section with an aurora-themed background or illustration, a bold headline, and a CTA button.
Highlight major features in a 2-3 column layout (“AI-powered”, “Fast Cloud Processing”, “Stunning Effects”).
Showcase a brief video or image carousel of sample AI-generated results to spark interest.
Include an FAQ or “How it works” section if relevant.
Integrate open-graph meta tags for social sharing.
Implementation Details:

File(s) to Update: src/pages/LandingPage.tsx, meta tags in index.html or a Head/Helmet component.
Hero Section: Large, full-width banner with a gradient or a background video snippet.
Features: Use icons or small images for clarity. Keep text short, focusing on benefits.
CTA: “Sign up now” or “Start generating videos” in a contrasting button color.
Social & SEO: Add <meta> tags for og:title, og:description, og:image. Include a sensible <title> and <meta name='description'>. 5. Mobile Responsiveness
Prompt:

Ensure Full Mobile Responsiveness

Test each component (Navigation, Dashboard, Forms, Video Preview) on small screens (320px+).
Convert multi-column layouts to single column on narrow devices.
Use a mobile-friendly hamburger menu or bottom tab bar for navigation.
Verify all clickable/tappable areas have sufficient size and spacing.
Implementation Details:

File(s) to Check: All layout components (NavigationBar, Dashboard, VideoForm, etc.).
Tailwind Responsive Classes: md:, lg:, xl: breaks. For example, grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 for a responsive grid.
Nav: Hide the desktop nav links behind a hamburger icon using @media (max-width: ...) or Tailwind breakpoints.
Check: Confirm no horizontal scrollbars or overflow. If found, adjust widths or use overflow-hidden.
Testing: Emulate devices in browser dev tools and ensure all critical functionality remains accessible. 6. Performance Optimization
Prompt:

Optimize Performance and Build Size

Implement code splitting with dynamic imports for heavy modules (video player, advanced forms).
Lazy-load images/video thumbnails on the dashboard.
Compress or convert images to modern formats (WebP/AVIF) for faster load times.
Remove unused dependencies and console logs.
Monitor bundle size with Vite’s analyzer plugin.
Implementation Details:

Dynamic Import: For large components, const VideoPlayer = React.lazy(() => import('./VideoPlayer')).
Lazy Loading: Only load media when visible (e.g., react-lazyload or Intersection Observer).
Bundling: Use rollup-plugin-visualizer or Vite’s built-in stats to see what's large.
Cleanup: Remove console.log statements or dev-only code.
Testing: Use Lighthouse or Chrome dev tools Performance tab to measure improvement. 7. Error Handling & User Feedback
Prompt:

Enhance Error Handling and User Feedback

Display form validation errors inline with a red accent and short messages.
Show toast notifications for server errors (auth, video generation) with retry options.
Use a React Error Boundary to catch unexpected crashes and show a user-friendly fallback.
For successful actions (video generation completed, user profile saved), show a brief success toast.
Implementation Details:

Toast: Possibly the shadcn-ui toast. Provide a short description and an “X” close icon.
Inline Validation: Use the validation from Step 1. For errors, highlight the field border in red.
Server Errors: E.g., if /generate-video fails, show a toast “We couldn’t generate your video. Try again or come back later.”
Error Boundary: Wrap top-level routes or components in an <ErrorBoundary> to handle uncaught exceptions. Display fallback UI instead of a blank screen. 8. Documentation & Metadata Setup
Prompt:

Add Comprehensive Documentation and Metadata

Expand README.md with installation steps, environment variables, usage instructions, and deployment guidelines.
Write a “How To Use” doc that covers key flows (uploading prompts, generating videos, previewing results).
Add licensing info (LICENSE file) if needed.
Include a CHANGELOG.md for major changes.
Ensure meta tags (title, description, favicon) are properly set for the final build.
Implementation Details:

README: Outline the project purpose, usage, contributing guidelines, environment variables.
How To Use: A separate markdown file in /docs or part of the README. Step through the user’s journey from sign-up to final video.
License: MIT or another license, placed in root as LICENSE.
Changelog: Summarize major features, bug fixes.
Meta Tags: In index.html or a <Helmet> component for React. Provide <title> and <meta name="description">.
FINAL NOTES
Address Build Failures: Follow the Lovable.dev error messages carefully. Often, small tweaks like removing unused imports, properly typing props, or updating a toast variant will fix the build.
Incremental Commits: Commit each step in a separate branch or with a descriptive commit message, so you can revert if something breaks.
Testing: After each step, build and deploy a preview in Lovable.dev (or locally) to confirm functionality before proceeding.
Production Check: Once all tasks are done, test thoroughly: run a Lighthouse audit, QA each flow on multiple devices, and confirm no console errors.
By following these prompt-style steps, you can systematically improve and finalize your Aurora Video Synthesizer web application for production deployment.
